# How to Roll Out Version 8 to Internal Testers

## Current Status
✅ Version 8 is already **released** and **available to internal testers**

## Steps to Ensure Testers Can Access It:

### 1. Add Testers to Internal Testing List

1. In Google Play Console, go to: **Testing** → **Internal testing**
2. Click on **"Testers"** tab (at the top)
3. You'll see options to add testers:
   - **Email addresses**: Add up to 100 email addresses
   - **Google Groups**: Add a Google Group
   - **Google+ Communities**: (if applicable)

4. Add your testers' email addresses
5. Click **"Save changes"**

### 2. Share the Testing Link

1. Still in **Testing** → **Internal testing** → **Testers** tab
2. Look for **"Copy link"** or **"Opt-in URL"**
3. Copy the testing link (looks like: `https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/...`)
4. Share this link with your testers via email, message, etc.

### 3. Testers Need to:

1. **Open the testing link** you shared (on their Android device)
2. **Opt in** to become a tester
3. **Wait a few minutes** for the opt-in to process
4. **Open Google Play Store** on their device
5. Search for "Vreme CC" or go to: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vreme.cc
6. They should see an **"Update"** or **"Install"** button
7. Install/update the app

### 4. Verify Testers Can Access

- Testers should see version **1.0.7 (8)** in the app (top-right corner)
- The rotation fix should work when they flip their tablet

## Troubleshooting

**If testers don't see the update:**
- Make sure they've opted in using the testing link
- Wait 15-30 minutes after opting in
- Clear Play Store cache: Settings → Apps → Google Play Store → Clear cache
- Check that they're using the same Google account that received the testing invitation

**If you need to add more testers:**
- Go back to **Testers** tab
- Add more email addresses (up to 100 total)
- They'll receive an email invitation
